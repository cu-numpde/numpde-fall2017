1. diffmat(x) matrix with central difference approximation gives 2nd order.
2. Adding non-symmetric approximation (first order) at boundary points reduces the global order of direvatives approximation. 
3. diff2mat(x) matrix gives second order approximation of second derivative.
4. Boundary value problems can have Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. Dirichlet BC are exact and Neumann BC can be approximated to second order.
